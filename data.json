More spacing between appointments gives us the time to keep everyone safe. This, however, requires an overhaul (change of date & time) of all prior scheduled appointments. If you have a prior appointment, plaese expect us to contact you two weeks in advance to confirm the changed date & time.{"\n"}{"\n"}That said, please call us right away if you have an urgent dnetal need.
