More spacing between appointments gives us the time to keep everyone safe. This, however, requires an overhaul (change of date & time) of all prior scheduled appointments. If you have a prior appointment, please expect us to contact you two weeks in advance to confirm the changed date & time.\n\nThat said, please call us right away if you have an urgent dental need. We are always ready for phone calls to 610-345-0267, emails to SCCFD08@gmail.com, and through this app's Virtual Forms.",
